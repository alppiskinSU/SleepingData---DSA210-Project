# SleepingData---DSA210-Project

## Project Overwiev
This project explores how sleep duration and quality impact academic performance. Sleep is a critical factor in cognitive function, study time, and study quality. The goal is to analyze whether better sleep habits lead to improved academic success.

## Motivation

- **Personal Growth**

Sleep is an essential part of overall well-being. By understanding how my sleep patterns influence my academic performance, I can develop healthier and more efficient habits to improve my efficiency in studying.

- **Long-Term Impact**

The findings of this project will not only help me enhance my academic performance, but they also contribute to developing better sleep habits for increased productivity, focus, and mental and physical well-being. 

## Objectives
- Investigate the correlation between sleep duration and studying time and quality.
- Identify the optimal sleep schedule for better learning efficiency.
- Examine how sleep quality affects focus and productivity during study sessions.

## Data Sources
To conduct this analysis, data will be collected through the following sources:

- **Sleep Duration:** Total sleep duration (hours).
- **Sleep Quality:** Self-rated sleep quality (scale of 1-10).
- **Study Time:** Tracked manually with using chronometer.
- **Study Quality:** Self-rated study quality ( scale of 1-10).
- **Academic Performance:** Grades from the midterm exams. ( This may vary due to difficulty of lesson but in previous semesters sleep affected my exam grades significantly )

## Analysis Plan
The collected data will undergo statistical and visual analysis to uncover key aspects:

- **Correlation Analysis:** Determining whether there is strong link between sleep patterns and academic performance.
- **Sleep-Wake Pattern Evaluation:** Finding the best time to sleep and wake up for improved learning.
- **Data Visualization:** Using scatter plots, time-series graphs to present findings effectively.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of the study, this project aims to answer the following questions:

- Does getting more sleep lead to better academic performance?
- Is there an ideal sleep schedule for increased focus and learning efficiency?
- How does poor sleep impact productivity and retention of information?
